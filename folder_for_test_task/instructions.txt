Your task is to write uniq_sum function defined in the file task.py
This function takes two lists as arguments, and should return only UNIQUE values from both lists (without any duplicates)
as a list. Returned list should also be sorted numerically (i.e. 2 should be on position before 3, etc.)
See examples if in doubt. 

To test your solution, run 'python -m unittest task.py' from the command line (or bash, if you use mac/linux)

When finished, push the whole repository on github. Example:
'git add .'
'git commit -m 'your message'
'git push origin main'
